# python-task3
This project is a simple Grade Calculation Program written in Python.
It takes marks as input from the user, validates the input, and displays the corresponding grade and message using if-elif-else conditions and logical operators.
The program does not use return statements and prints the output directly, making it easy to understand for beginners.
